## Notes:

The multiloader function is **complex and really messy** – I just didn’t know how to do it better at that time.

Also:  
**If you don’t know how to add includes or link functions, do not download this source. Thanks!**

### How to add includes:
Go to:  
`Properties > C/C++ > General`  
and add your includes in:  
**Additional Include Directories**

### Important lines to check:
- **94–249**
- **421–436**
- **576–595**

I added some notes in German – translate them yourself, I’m too lazy right now.

### Base:
For this multiloader, I used a base/rework from **Baikz**.
